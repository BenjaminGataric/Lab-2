        <h2><strong>Instructions</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Place oven rack in the lower position and preheat to 300°F. Combine sugar, salt, paprika, cumin, black pepper, coriander, ground fennel seed, and cayenne pepper in a bowl mix well. Season pork with 2-3 tablespoons spice mixture </li>
            <li> Whisk ketchup, molasses, half of cider vinegar, Worcestershire, liquid smoke, mustard and hot sauce in a bowl. Whisk in remaining spice mixture </li>
            <li> Heat oil over medium-high heat till shimmering. Add pork and cook, turning occasionally untill well browned on all sides. 5 minutes total. Add onion and cook, stirring and scraping browned bits from the bottom of the pan, until softened in about 2 minutes </li>
            <li> Turn off burner and add bourbon, relight burner. Carefully ignite the bourbon with a long match or a lighter. Let cook until flames die out, about 2 minutes. </li>
            <li> Make sure pork is oriented fat side up. Add half of the sauce and chicken stock or water. Cover Dutch Oven transfer to oven, and cook until pork is just starting to turn tender, about 4 hours. Remove lid and continue cooking until a knife or fork shows very little resistance when twisted inside the meat and a dark bark has formed, about 1 more hour </li>
            <li> Transfer pork to a large bowl, save some liquid in the pot. Using a ladle, skim off excess fat and discard. Add reserved sauce and remmaining vinegar to pot and whisk to combine. When pork is cool enough to handle, shred with two forks</li>
            <li> Transfer shredded pork to pot and toss with the remaining sauce. Season to taste with salt, sugar, liquid smoke, or cider vinegar. Serve </li>
        </ol>
